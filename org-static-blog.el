;;; org-static-blog.el --- a simple org-mode based static blog generator

;; Author: Bastian Bechtold
;; URL: https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog
;; Version: 1.2.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.3"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Static blog generators are a dime a dozen. This is one more, which
;; focuses on being simple. All files are simple org-mode files in a
;; directory. The only requirement is that every org file must have a
;; #+TITLE and a #+DATE, and optionally, #+FILETAGS.

;; This file is also available from marmalade and melpa-stable.

;; Set up your blog by customizing org-static-blog's parameters, then
;; call M-x org-static-blog-publish to render the whole blog or
;; M-x org-static-blog-publish-file filename.org to render only only
;; the file filename.org.

;; Above all, I tried to make org-static-blog as simple as possible.
;; There are no magic tricks, and all of the source code is meant to
;; be easy to read, understand and modify.

;; If you have questions, if you find bugs, or if you would like to
;; contribute something to org-static-blog, please open an issue or
;; pull request on Github.

;; Finally, I would like to remind you that I am developing this
;; project for free, and in my spare time. While I try to be as
;; accomodating as possible, I can not guarantee a timely response to
;; issues. Publishing Open Source Software on Github does not imply an
;; obligation to *fix your problem right now*. Please be civil.
